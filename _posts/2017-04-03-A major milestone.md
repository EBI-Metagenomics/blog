## A New Post
This week, EBI Metagenomics hit a major milestone as we passed over one thousand
publicly available projects on the site. This corresponds to over 60,000 samples, comprising
more than 80,000 individual runs, and represents the analysis of over 300 billion nucleotide
sequences from a wide range of environmental biomes.

We would like to thank all of our users for their support and feedback, particularly our
submitters who have provided their data for analysis. As metagenomic data grows at
an ever-increasing rate, we look forward to supporting the analysis of the next 1000
projects and beyond.
