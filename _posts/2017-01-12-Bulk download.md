## Interested in bulk download of our data?
Did you know that we provide a Python script for the bulk download of publicly available project data? The tool iterates over all samples and runs in a project and builds an appropriate root URL, which it uses to download individual run result files. Different file types can be specified, allowing you to download, for example, all reads encoding 16S rRNAs, all taxonomic assignments, or all predicted protein coding sequences, for a particular project. To find out more, click the 'Bulk download script' link below.
