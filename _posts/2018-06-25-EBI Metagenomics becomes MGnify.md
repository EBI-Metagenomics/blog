We are pleased to announce that EBI Metagenomics has changed its name to MGnify in preparation for a series of forthcoming updates and improvements with the resource. The change also reflects the increasingly collaborative nature of the project within EMBL and across the scientific community. MGnify will continue to be a free resource for the assembly, analysis, archiving and browsing of all types of microbiome derived sequence data, providing insights into the phylogenetic diversity and functional potential of environmental samples. In addition to the new name, the website has been completely re-written to take advantage of our new API, which provides access to the metadata and analysis results.
 

The site is currently in Beta. Check out the new interface on https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/beta/ and let our team know what you think: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/metagenomics.
